\qs{34}{Find all the subgroups of $\ZZ_3 \times \ZZ_3$. Use this information to show that $\ZZ_3 \times \ZZ_3 \not \cong \ZZ_9$. }
\sol The subgroups of $\ZZ_3 \times \ZZ_3$ are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\ZZ_3 \times \ZZ_3$
    \item $\{ (0,0) \}$
    \item $\{ (0,0), (1, 0), (2, 0)\}$
    \item $\{ (0,0), (0, 1), (0, 2)\}$
    \item $\{ (0,0), (1, 1), (2, 2)\}$
    \item $\{ (0,0), (1, 2), (2, 1)\}$
\end{itemize}

The subgroups of $\ZZ_9$ are: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\ZZ_9$
    \item $\{ 0 \}$
    \item $\{ 0, 3, 6 \}$
\end{itemize}

\noindent Since these groups have different sets of subgroups, they are not isomorphic. In other words, $\ZZ_3 \times \ZZ_3 \not \cong \ZZ_9$.

\qs{35}{Find all the subgroups of the symmetry group of an equilateral triangle}
\sol There are 4 things we have to check for: closed under the operation, identity, inverse, and associativity:

\textbf{Closed}: If we have $a + b\sqrt{2} \in G$ and $c + d\sqrt{2} \in G$, then their product is $(ac + 2bd) + (ad + bc)\sqrt{2}$. We know that this is in $G$ because if $a,b,c,d \in \QQ$, then we know that $(ac+2bd),(ad+bc) \in \QQ$ too because of closure of rationals. Therefore $G$ is closed under the operation of multiplication.

\textbf{Identity} The identity for $G$ is 1. We know that 1 is in $G$ because $0,1 \in \QQ$ and if $a,b \in \QQ$, then $a + b\sqrt{2}$ is in $G$.

\qs{41}{Prove that $$G = \{a + b\sqrt{2} : a,b \in \QQ \land a,b \neq 0 \}$$

is a subgroup of $\RR^*$ under the group operation of multiplication. }
\sol

\qs{45}{Prove that the intersection of two subgroups of a group $G$ is also a subgroup of $G$.}
\sol

\qs{46}{Prove or disprove: If $H$ and $K$ are subgroups of a group $G$, then $H \cup K$ is a subgroup of $G$.}
\sol

\qs{47}{Prove or disprove: If $H$ and $K$ are subgroups of a group $G$, then $HK = \{hk : h \in H \land k \in K \}$ is a subgroup of $G$. What is $G$ is abelian?}
\sol

\qs{48}{Let $G$ be a group and $g \in G$. Show that $$Z(G) = \{ x \in G : gx = xg \text{ for all } g \in G\}$$ is a subgroup of $G$. This subgroup is called the \textbf{center} of $G$.}
\sol

\qs{53}{Let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$ and $$C(H) = \{g \in G : gh = hg \text{ for all } h \in H \}.$$ Prove that $C(H)$ is a subgroup of $G$. This group is called the \textbf{centralizer} of $H$ in $G$.}
\sol

\qs{54}{Let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$. If $g \in G$, show that $gHg^{-1} = \{ ghg^{-1} : h \in H\}$ is also a subgroup of $G$. }
