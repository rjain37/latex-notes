\qs{2}{Which of the following multiplication tables defined on the set $G = \{a, b, c, d\}$ form a group? Support your answer in each case.}
\sol

\qs{7}{Let $S = \RR$ \textbackslash $\{-1\}$ and define a binary operation on $S$ by $a * b = a + b + ab$. Prove that $(S, *)$ is an abelian group.}
\sol

\qs{17}{Give an example of three different groups with eight elements. Why are the groups
different?}
\sol

\qs{25}{Let $a$ and $b$ be elements in a group $G$. Prove that $ab^na^{-1} = (aba^{-1})^n$ for $n \in \ZZ$.}
\sol

\qs{31}{Show that if $a^2 = e$ for all elements a in a group $G$, then $G$ must be abelian.}
\sol

\qs{32}{Show that if $G$ is a finite group of even order, then there is an $a \in G$ such that $a$ is not the identity and $a^2 = e$.}
\sol

\qs{33}{Let $G$ be a group and suppose that $(ab)^2 = a^2b^2$ for all $a$ and $b$ in $G$. Prove that $G$ is an abelian group.}
