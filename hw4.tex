\qs{5}{List the subgroups of $S_4$. Find each of the following sets:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
    \item $\displaystyle \{ \sigma \in S_4 : \sigma(1) = 3 \}$
    \item $\displaystyle \{ \sigma \in S_4 : \sigma(2) = 2 \}$
    \item $\displaystyle \{ \sigma \in S_4 : \sigma(1) = 3$ and $\sigma(2) = 2 \}$
\end{enumerate}}

\qs{6}{Find all of the subgroups in $A_4$. What is the order of each subgroup?}
\sol

\qs{7}{Find all possible orders of elements in $S_7$ and $A_7$.}

\qs{23}{If $\sigma$ is a cycle of odd length, prove that $\sigma^2$ is also a cycle.}
\sol Let's say that $\sigma$ has length $k$ and that it can be written in cycle notation as $(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k)$. Then $\sigma^2$ is the permutation $(a_1, a_3, \ldots, a_k, a_2, a_4, \ldots a_{k-1})$. The term $a_{k-1}$ would be sent to $a_1$ which would complete the cycle if $k$ is odd since $k-1$ would then be even. 

\qs{25}{Prove that in $A_n$ for $n\geq 3$, any permutation is a product of cycles of length 3. }
\sol

\qs{29}{Recall that the the \textbf{\emph{center}} of a group $G$ is
\begin{equation*}
    Z(G) = \{ g \in G : gx = xg \text{ for all } x \in G \}\text{.}
    \end{equation*}
    Find the center of $D_8$. What about the center of $D_{10}$? What is the center of $D_n$?
